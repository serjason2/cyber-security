## Vocabulary
**Cybersecurity (or security):** The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

**Threat Actor:** Any person or group who presents a security risk.

**Benefits of Security:**
* Protects against external and internal threats
* Meets regulatory compliance
* Maintain and improves business productivity
* Reduces expenses
* Maintains brand trust

**Common Job Titles**
* Security Analyst or Specialist
* Cybersecurity Analyst or Specialist
* Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst
* Information Security Analyst

**Security Analyst Responsibilities:**
* Protecting computer and network systems
* Installing prevention softwares
* Conducting periodic security audits

**Operations:** Responding to detections and doing investigations

**Projects:** Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections

"A playbook is a list how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents."

**Common Cybersecurity Terminology**
* **Compliance**: is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
* **Security frameworks**: are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
* **Security controls**: are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
* **Security posture**: is an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
* **A threat actor**: or malicious attacker, is any person or group that presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.
* **An internal threat**: can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor *intentionally* engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
* **Network security**: is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization's network.
* **Cloud security**: is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
* **Programming**: is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
  * Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
  * Reviewing web traffic
  * Alerting suspicious activity

**Security Analyst transferable skills**
* Communication
* Collaboration
* Analysis
* Problem-solving

**Security Analyst technical skills**
* Programming languages
* SIEM tools
* Data analysis

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Any information used to infer an individual's identity.

**Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)**: A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.

**Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
