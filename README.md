## Vocabulary
**Cybersecurity (or security):** The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

**Threat Actor:** Any person or group who presents a security risk.

**Benefits of Security:**
* Protects against external and internal threats
* Meets regulatory compliance
* Maintain and improves business productivity
* Reduces expenses
* Maintains brand trust

**Common Job Titles**
* Security Analyst or Specialist
* Cybersecurity Analyst or Specialist
* Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst
* Information Security Analyst

**Security Analyst Responsibilities:**
* Protecting computer and network systems
* Installing prevention softwares
* Conducting periodic security audits

**Operations:** Responding to detections and doing investigations

**Projects:** Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections

"A playbook is a list how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents."

**Common Cybersecurity Terminology**
* **Compliance**: is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
* **Security frameworks**: are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
* **Security controls**: are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
* **Security posture**: is an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
* **A threat actor**: or malicious attacker, is any person or group that presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.
* **An internal threat**: can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor *intentionally* engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
* **Network security**: is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization's network.
* **Cloud security**: is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
* **Programming**: is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
  * Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
  * Reviewing web traffic
  * Alerting suspicious activity

**Security Analyst transferable skills**
* Communication
* Collaboration
* Analysis
* Problem-solving

**Security Analyst technical skills**
* Programming languages
* SIEM tools
* Data analysis

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Any information used to infer an individual's identity.

**Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)**: A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.

**Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

**Computer Virus**: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.

**Malware**: A software designed to harm devices or networks.
- **Viruses**: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
- **Worms**: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across system on its own. In contract to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- **Ransomware**: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
- **Spyware**: Malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent. Spycare can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

**Social engineering**: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:
- **Social media phishing**: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.
- **Watering hole attack**: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB Baiting**: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowningly infect a network.
- **Physical social engineering**: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

**Phishing**: The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include:
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
- **Spear phishing**: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.
- **Whaling attack**: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing**: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
- **Smishing**: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

During a data breach, you have to stay calm.
"The first thing you're going to do is, contain the breach."

**The eight CISSP security domains**
**Eight Domains**
1. **Security and Risk Management**: Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.
2. **Asset Security**: Secures digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**: Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.
4. **Communication and Network Security**: Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.
5. **Identity and Access Management**: Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
6. **Security Assessment and Testing**: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
7. **Security Operations**: Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
8. **Software Development Security**: Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
